  HEADER

  Edit the values in the block above to be appropriate for your workshop.
  If the value is not 'true', 'false', 'null', or a number, please use
  double quotation marks around the value, unless specified otherwise.
  And run 'tools/check' *before* committing to make sure that changes are good.

  EVENTBRITE

  This block includes the Eventbrite registration widget if
  'eventbrite' has been set in the header.  You can delete it if you
  are not using Eventbrite, or leave it in, since it will not be
  displayed if the 'eventbrite' field in the header is not set.

  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>The <a href="http://platforms.monash.edu/bioinformatics/" target="_blank">Monash Bioinformatics Platform</a> want to help make introductory bioinformatic approaches part of the research landscape in Biomedicine. To do this, a foundation level of expertise amongst as many researchers as possible is an important step forward. The platform will then be available to facilitate this work as well as develop more advanced bioinformatic projects with our researchers.</p>

<p>We are running a two day hands-on workshop with a focus on enabling researchers to be able to analyse RNASeq (next-gen sequencing) data.
<ul>
  <li><strong>Day 1</strong>, we will begin by teaching an introduction to programming using the <a href="https://www.r-project.org" target="_blank">R</a> language.</li>
  <li><strong>Day 2</strong> will focus on using this knowledge to perform bioinformatic data analysis of some RNASeq data.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>
  The workshop will be taught in a similar style to Software Carpentry workshops. <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a>'s mission
  is to help scientists and engineers get more research done in less
  time and with less pain by teaching them basic lab skills for
  scientific computing.

  ETHERPAD

  At `_misc/etherpad.txt` you will find a template for the etherpad.

  Display the Etherpad for the workshop.  You can set this up in
  advance or on the first day; either way, make sure you push changes
  to GitHub after you have its URL.  To create an Etherpad, go to

      http://etherpad.mozilla.org/YYYY-MM-DD-site

  where 'YYYY-MM-DD-site' is the identifier for your workshop (e.g.,
  '2015-06-10-esu'.

{% if page.etherpad %}
<p>
  <strong>Etherpad:</strong> <a href="{{page.etherpad}}">{{page.etherpad}}</a>.

  We will use this Etherpad for chatting, taking notes, and sharing URLs and bits of code.

  SYLLABUS

  Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

  This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.
